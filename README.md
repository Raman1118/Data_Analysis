Problem Description:
The objective of this project is to analyze Airbnb rental prices and occupancy rates in New York City. The project uses the Airbnb dataset from Kaggle, which contains information on Airbnb listings in New York City, including the rental prices, occupancy rates, and other variables such as location, type of property, and number of bedrooms.
The goal of the project is to gain insights into the factors that affect Airbnb rental prices and occupancy rates in New York City, and to develop a predictive model that can forecast rental prices and occupancy rates based on various variables.
Dataset: The dataset used in this project is the New York City Airbnb Open Data from Kaggle. The dataset contains information on 48,895 Airbnb listings in New York City, including the rental prices, occupancy rates, and various other variables such as location, type of property, and number of bedrooms. The dataset covers a period of 11 years, from 2008 to 2019.

• id: Unique identifier for each listing
• name: Name of the listing
• host_id: Unique identifier for each host
• hostname: Name of the host
• neighbourhood_group: The borough in which the listing is located (Bronx, Brooklyn,
Manhattan, Queens, or Staten Island)

affect rental prices and occupancy rates in New York City
• Data preprocessing and cleaning to ensure data quality and integrity
• Development of a predictive model that can forecast rental prices and occupancy rates
based on various variables.
• Creation of visualizations and dashboards to communicate the findings and insights
